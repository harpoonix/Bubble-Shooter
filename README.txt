Required Features implemented
-collisions between bullets and bubbles. On collision, both bullet and bubble are erased
-bubbles now move under influence of gravity in a parabolic path, and bounce off the ground
-the shooter takes damage (and health is reduced by 1) when it is hit by a bubble. The bubble is popped when it 
hits the shooter.

Extra features implemented
-Bubbles of different sizes used. When bigger bubbles hit, they split into 2 smaller bubbles moving in horizontally 
opposite directions.
-Different levels of the game implemented. When one level is cleared, a congratulatory message is diplayed, and on clicking 
the screen, the next level starts. The next level is harder in terms of more bubbles, higher order of bubbles (for level 3),
faster moving bubbles. Different color used for bubbles in different levels.

Other features
-health count implemented, shooter can get hit only limited number of times before it loses
-cheat code 'c' for moving to next level, for showing and testing purposes. Press c on keyboard to play next level.
-shooter visually takes damage when hit by bubble
